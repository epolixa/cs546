                We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our
                imagination. Every time you practice, you learn more All you
                need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a
                vision in your mind. Just beat the devil out of it. Let all
                these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.
                You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

                These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just
                let them happen. And just raise cain. Let's go up in here, and
                start having some fun We're not trying to teach you a thing to
                copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you
                loose into the world. In this world, everything can be happy.
